% Document Begins
\begin{document}
\maketitle
% \tableofcontents Optional table-of-contents
% \clearpage clears page on table of contents so content starts on new page.

% Includes content body. If the essay is very long, it might make sense to split
% the content across multiple .tex files, and include them all here, e.g.
% \input{sections/preamble.tex}
\input{sections/body.tex}
\clearpage
\input{sections/endpage.tex}

\end{document}
